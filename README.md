This react component provides a slack like rich text editing experience powered by [lexical library](https://lexical.dev). This project is currently in alpha stage and used internally for [Remindoro extension](https://palerdot.in/remindoro).

NOTE: Starting `v0.2.0`, `react-slite` is powered by [lexical](https://github.com/facebook/lexical). Right now, it is just a thin wrapper around vanilla lexical functionality. As lexical becomes more stable and moves towards `v1.x`, this library will become more feature complete. Till then, apis are subject to change.
